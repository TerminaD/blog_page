<p>It seems that not only are the fans keeping count, it’s oklama himself too: <strong>it’s been 1855 days, more than 5 years, since his last full-length album release, <em>DAMN.</em></strong> Granted, in the void of his absense, he has hopped on quite a bit of features, most notably on his cousin Baby Keem’s debut album, <em>The Melodic Blue</em>, masterminded the <em>Black Panther</em> album, and joining hands with director Dave Free, founded pgLang, an agency catering to artists from all desciplines and is now his base of operation.</p>
<p>Kendrick has never been the social media type: a fact evident from the scaricity of his tweets and the man’s own words: “I go months without a phone.” Only through his albums are we able to catch a fleeting yet humbling glance into his life and psyche: an insight all of us desperately needed in the five years preceding this album release. The pandemic. The largest tide of BLM activisim recent years have seen. The pain and tribulation that follows. The uncertainly and pain laced into all of our’s lives. Kendrick have, time and time again, provided his spin on these subjects. But this time he hasn’t. <strong>Kendrick’s absence has only grown more deafening in his silence. But now he has spoken, albeit not necessarily as expected.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You see Kendrick’s album before you hear it.</strong> The black van on <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>‘s cover is a snapshot frozen in time for an album following Kendrick’s youth, so refined and sincere in its storytelling that it’s almost cinematic, with all its near-ODs, house break-ins, lust, and the feeling of lost and heart-wrenching grief. As for <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, the political messaging couldn’t be clearer: a gang of black men posing in front of the White House, holding liquor bottles and thick stacks of cash, a judge laying dead at their feet, and an innocent baby held high in Kendrick’s arms. And <em>DAMN.</em>‘s cover is as simple and striking as the album itself: a Kendrick, cold-glared. That’s it.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>The cover art for <em>Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers</em> is unlike any of that: Kendrick and his fiancée Whitney Alford each were holding a kid in their arms, Kendrick wearing a crown of thorns covered in diamonds, a reference to the Bible, with a gun tucked under his belt. Being the first time Witney and her kids have made public appearance, <strong>the cover is surprisingly personal and intimate for Kendrick,</strong> whose fatherhood and personal life we have heard very little about. Yet the thorns and the gun still hints, however subtly, that Kendrick is still Kendrick: <strong>he has shots to fire, pun intended.</strong></p>
<p>This duality is also somewhat confirmed in this album’s arrangement: the 18-track is evenly split into two disks, as Kendrick has posted in this photo, respectively labeled “The Big Steppers” and “Mr. Morale”. <em>DAMN.</em> has sparkled quite a bit of theory revolving around the track listing, some of which somewhat grounded, most of them not. This time it’s for real though: the album is structurally intricate, with the two halves of it mirroring each other in track listing and the emotional rollercoaster it entails.</p>
<p><strong>On the first disk, “The Big Steppers”, Kendrick seems to be mostly stuck at the emotional wreck he was in back in <em>DAMN.</em></strong> The opening track <em><strong>United in Grief</strong></em> is a quick update on Kendrick’s life after <em>DAMN.</em>, with him chanting “I grief different” over marching drums, foreshadowing the first disk’s harrowing tone.</p>
<p>The second track <em><strong>N95</strong></em> is to this album what <em>HUMBLE.</em> is to <em>DAMN.</em>: a chart-climbing banger, braggadocious and shot-firing. <strong>Over a trap-vibed beat packed with glaring horns and deep tumbling bass, Kendrick spills out an laundry list of things he despise that just keeps going</strong>: “Take off the foo-foo&#x2F; take off the clout chase&#x2F; take off the Wi-Fi”, “Take off the fake deep&#x2F; take off the fake woke&#x2F; take off the ‘I’m broke, I care’&#x2F; Take off the gossip&#x2F; take off the new logic that if I’m rich, I’m rare” His arsenal of flows, one menacing, one wild and one yelping, along with Baby Keem on the hook, has this eccentric yet you-just-can’t-take-your-eyes-off chemistry that no other duo quite has.</p>
<p><strong><em>Worldwide Steppers</em> is one of the most lyrically dense moments on the first disk.</strong> After discussing his fatherhood and infidelities, Kendrick went on to accuse everyone, 8 billion of them, of being a killer, “walking zombies trying to scratch that itch”: be it the media wiping out individual opinion, or the music industry mistreating artists, or himself, who in his mindless lust-chasing, has brought great pain upon his partner. The thumping drums, though giving the track a spooky and menacing air, is way too dry and lacking in substance to carry this track through.</p>
<p><em><strong>Die Hard</strong></em> is a groovy song about love and walking out of the shadows of one’s past. The bounce the drums and cowbell combination brings to the table, the ethereal vocals in the background, and Amamda Reifer’s absolutely blissful voice singing the intoxicatingly sweet hook make this track a luxurious and glistening addition to an otherwise pretty much bells-and-whistles-free album.</p>
<p><em><strong>Father Time</strong></em> is Kendrick’s first deep dive into his past traumas. He, in signature panoramic detail, recalled how his father would treat him with little display of affection, not accepting his failures and himself’s weaknesses. <strong>This coldness has trickled down into Kendrick as well</strong>, making him reluctant to accept or display affection. He also turned his attention to those who grew up without a father: a wound seen only too often in black communities choking in poverty. “Learn shit ‘bout bein’ a man and disguise it as bein’ gangsta”, he observed, and prayed that this generational curse won’t poison the next generation much like Kendrick and his father. Despite the lyrical density, the music ain’t slacking either: the piano chords on this track is THE best the album has to offer, and Sampha on the hook singing “No chaser, neat” really takes the track’s emotional intensity to another level.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rich (Interlude)</strong></em> has Kodak Black rapping over plain piano keys about how he went from rags to riches. Now, Kodak’s heavily being featured on the album has splashed quite a wave on social media (I’m very skeptical too), but Kendrick has his reasons: per his words, he saw in Kodak himself, trapped in the hood, having an upward drive but having nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Following the interlude, <em><strong>Rich Spirit</strong></em> is chill and catchy, with Kendrick floating over a thicc and bouncy bassline, discussing how he deals with all the pressure that comes with being rich and famous, facing them with his “rich spirit”.</p>
<p><em><strong>We Cry Together</strong></em> sees the first disk at its bleakest. <strong>Kendrick and Taylor Paige play the part of an arguing couple, throwing absolutely dirty, obscene and insulting stuff into each other’s face without the least bit of constraint.</strong> Kendrick’s vocal performance is up to his usual par (which is to say, very impressive), but Taylour has outdone him: her voice is trembling and at the verge of tears, while somehow able to land every syllable with astounding ease: just listening to her desperate words is enough to get the andrenaline flowing in you. The swearing, originally aimed at each other, evolved into a downright onslaught of genderal hate. Like all things spectacular, this track arouses awe and uneasiness alike: where does the artist end and the art begin? Just how much of what he says on the track comes from a place of genuine believe and how much from putting on a show? Kendrick has never been the politically correct type. In fact, just a few tracks back in <em>N95</em>, among the things the “taking off” of which he urged for, “fake feminism” is among one of them. The track’s ending in the couple’s resolving to sex to end the argument, a twist on the word “fuck”, only adds to the powerlessness. “Stop tap-dancing around the conversation.” As Whitney herself concludes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Purple Hearts</strong></em> is a rather weak closer for the first disk, with mediocre lyricism (plus a few questionable one-liners) and music, that tries to capture, to little avail, some vague concept of love and sprituality.</p>
<p><strong>“The Big Stepper” is the Kendrick we are all introduced to in <em>DAMN.</em>: cold, braggadocios, yet also emotionally in ruins: the world is burning, social media and consumerism being the horsemen of the apocalypse, religion provides a spotty answer and love, while being the only refuge, is crumbling down because of his own shady past and wrongdoings.</strong> In a similar fashion, “Mr. Morale” is also another facet of Kendrick, though this time the face of which to us remains unknown.</p>
<p>In the opener <em><strong>Count Me Out</strong></em>, a female voice announces: “Session 10, breakthrough.”, suggesting that this track might be a result of Kendrick’s efforts to sort himself out through music. Apart from the usual untrustworthy homies and girls and the self-destructive tendencies, there is a new message: “I love it when you count me out.” This track’s sprituality elements and the wild “brrrt”s and “woo”s remind us of Kanye and Kid Cudi’s collab track <em>Feel the Love</em>: itself also being the start to a journey of healing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Crown</strong></em> further elaborates Kendrick’s overall emotional wreck, this time focusing on love: <strong>is it just a game of give or take? When the fame and the cash is gone, who would stick around?</strong> He lands at an answer he chants over and over again: “I can’t please everybody.” But this track just can’t flow on a beat so stripped-back that it’s almost lazy: even Kendrick’s arsenal of flows get tiring very fast.</p>
<p><em><strong>Silent Hill</strong></em> is a downright trap track with huge and distorted 808s and Kodak Black delivering a long verse of his usual stuff. Honestly, this track seems to me just a water-downed and more generic version of <em>N95</em>. </p>
<p><em><strong>Savior (Interlude)</strong></em>, much like <em>Rich (Interlude)</em>, has a guest artist, this time Baby Keem, soloing over a stripped-back beat: he is also talking the rags-to-riches talk, but with a much more impressive vocal performance and detailed storytelling than Kodak Black’s take.</p>
<p>After the interlude we have <em><strong>Savior</strong></em>, which might be a career-defining moment for Kendrick: Kendrick has long viewed himself, and has been viewed as, a savior, be it of the rap game or of the black community. His savior complex has been apparent since <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>: he yearns to be the voice of change, yet failing that and seening the community he cares so much for changing for the worse, can’t help feel disappointed and betrayed. Hell, he is even wearing a crown of thorns  on the album cover! But: “Kendrick made you think about it&#x2F; <strong>but he is not your savior</strong>.” Neither is Cole, Future, or Lebron. The message is clear: the savior lives in you and you only. Kendrick seems eager to back up this message: he does not speak the truth you wish, he “tell the whole truth from A to Z”. He is flawed in his opinions: his previous stand on COVID is questionable, he now admits. He finds it difficult to love his neighbors too. And he still feels betrayed: do those who put on a smile actually feel happy for him? This image of a mortal man becomes only too real over the dizzying and menacing beat.</p>
<p><em><strong>Auntie Diaries</strong></em> follows two transgenders in Kendrick’s life: his aunt-turned-uncle and cousin. He recalled, with his trademark detail-packed storytelling, his aunt’s chill and cool character and all the hate he received for being trans. Yet with time taking its toll, Kendrick’s understanding of him grew, resulting in his standing up for his trans cousin as the pastor condemned his so-called sins. The track took an unexpected turn at the end, correlating the homophobic “faggot” with the racist “nigga” through referencing an infamous incident where he scolded a white fan saying the n-word while singing along with him on stage, examing them in the same light: when spoken without the intention to harm, they are but sounds, but with meanings attatched, they become swords too ready to wreck damage. <strong>The boldness to tackle slippery subject matters, the instrospection, and the keen eye for seeing how things connect and relate to each other in unexpected ways is so classically Kendrick.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Mr. Morale</strong></em> starts off with an anger-packed sample from an Youtube video, though originally aimed at a landslide football game, was repurposed to aim at the show Kendrick previously mentioned. This, along with wild vocalizations, a marching and tense beat and Kendrick’s depressive flow, give the track an errie and menacing quality. “Stepping out when the weight lifts”, “Tell you in pieces ‘cause it’s way too heavy”, this track seem to only be a preclude to something much darker and heavier weighing on Kendrick’s mental.</p>
<p>And we soon know what that is. In <em><strong>Mother I Sober</strong></em>, over broken piano keys, Kendrick tells a story that’s been told for generations. His mother, once violated, insisted that his cousin molested him, a childhood nightmare that manifested into his lust addiction and infidelities, wrecking damage to those he love and care. <strong>This cycle of abusers becoming victims is painfully way too common in black communities, he sighed.</strong> Is R. Kelly’s domestic abuse issues also a relic of his being molested? Do many more rappers use the jewellery and violence to cover up similar childhood traumas that ripped a hole inside of them that can’t be healed? Beth Gibbon’s hook is nothing but heart-wrenching: “I wish I was somebody&#x2F; Anybody but myself.” But there is still hope: Kendrick aspires to set free all the abusers, the victims, the guilt-bearers, the next generation that’s yet to be sucked in to this generational curse. “You did it&#x2F; You broke a generational curse.” Whitney applauded. Did he really? Or is his savior complex at work again?</p>
<p>In the closing track <em><strong>Mirror</strong></em>, Kendrick chants over and over again: “I choose me&#x2F; I’m sorry.” He elaborated his rather cryptic apology: “Sorry I didn’t save the world my friend&#x2F; I’m too busy building myself again”. </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Morale is the Kendrick that Kendrick wants to be, with all his traumas sorted out, a version of him more at peace with himself.</strong> The title for the closing track, that is “mirror”, and how the two disks line up in terms of track listing make it pretty clear: <strong>the big stepper and Mr. Morale are both Kendrick: two reflections of himself staring each other down in the mirror.</strong> He seems inclined to shift toward the latter: step out the social commentary, step out the world-saving, focus on the family, on setting himself straight. There’ve been bread crumbs all along the way if you’ve noticed: the rapeated mentions about seeing a therapist. The recurring excerpts of Dr. Sena, known for his ideas on spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>On <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>, Kendrick told a boiled-down version of his coming-of-age story, a story of how the streets of Compton chain you down and eat you up, and how he managed to escape. <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> displays a grander vision, of survivor’s guilt, of abuse of power, of homecoming, of infighting, but ultimately of the black experience, poor or rich. <em>DAMN.</em>, in an unfortunate clash of tuning the music to the general audience’s taste and Kendrick himself going through emotions too dense and heavy to unpack back then, left us with the impression of him in a place of emotional wreck, but without any idea of how he got there, or where he will head to.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers</em> is <em>DAMN.</em> unpacked, presented to us by a Kendrick who has got enough time to sort out his anger, his traumas, his flaws and his psyche, and is more ready to tell us about it.</strong> He still isn’t quite out of the shadows of his childhood traumas, hence “The Big Steppers”, but he has gathered the courage and mental clarity to tear open past wounds to start the healing, hence “Mr. Morale”. <strong>The latter aspect of himself is almost painful to watch: it’s intimate, personal, and gut-spilling to the point of embarrassing, painful and nerve-wracking: yet we just can’t turn our eyes away.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yet somehow Kendrick has found a way to make these personal subject matters relavent and relatable for not just himself, but also for the black community, and even for the broader human experience.</strong> Past Kendrick albums have been the voice of broad social change and rebellion, <strong>but this time he’s ready to speak the skeleton in the closet many of us have not the courage or the right voice to talk about, to let out, to set straight.</strong> “I’m sacrificing myself to start the healing”, per his words.</p>
<p>Granted, <em>Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers</em> is less coherent, less all-killer-no-filler than <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em> or <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, but that is inevitable when it comes to an album that comes from a place of authenticity and emotional intensity that leaves no room for grooming or bells and whistles. <strong>Kendrick, though taking off his crown of thorns, is still uniquely able to speak the unspoken, to speak the unspeakable.</strong> A round of applause, to Mr. Morale.</p>
